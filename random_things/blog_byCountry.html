This plot is straightforward -- it shows the number of Nobel Prizes awarded to nuclear
and particle physics every decade, decomposed in laureates' country. I need to clarify
two things.

First, what I mean by "country". This information is directly copied from
the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics">List of Nobel laureates in Physics</a>
. There's a footnote explanation for this which
reads "The information in the country column is according to nobelprize.org,
the official website of the Nobel Foundation. This information may not necessarily
reflect the recipient's birthplace or citizenship." Therefore, I do not guarantee
the accuracy of this information, although I regard it as a good approximation to
the information that this plot is trying to convey.

Second, the y-axis label reads "Number of Nobel Prize Rationales" and by rationale
I am referring to the reason that the Nobel committee gives to why they confer
the prize to the recipient. And here, importantly, I count <b>one rationale as one prize</b>.
In addition, if there are two (or more) recipients for one rationale, the prize is evenly distributed to
each one of them, for simplicity reason (I could do a better job by looking up the prize share each
year and do it that way, but I do not bother to do so). Moreover, if there are more
than one country listed for a particular recipient, the prize of that particular recipient's
share is evenly distributed to each listed country. To give a concrete example,
the 2008 prize is most illustrative. In 2008, there are three recipients and
two rationales, therefore, I will count a total of two prizes from year 2008. For Kobayashi
and Maskawa, they share one rationale for their contribution to the quark mixing matrix that bears their names.
Hence, they both get 0.5 prizes. Since there's only one country, Japan, for both of them,
Japan gets 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 prize from this rationale. The third recipient of this year
is Nambu for his contribution to spontaneous symmetry breaking which resulted in the particles
that bear his name (Nambu-Goldstone bosons). Since he's the only recipient for this
rationale and he has two countries listed, Japan and United States each gets 0.5 prize from
this rationale. Therefore, Japan got 0.5 &times; 3 = 1.5 prizes and United States got 0.5
prizes from year 2008. There's no particular reason or justification for choosing
this system (maybe I wanted to learn how to make weighted and stacked histograms in python
counts as a reason?), but I think it makes sense to me and doesn't change the big picture.

All that said, the plot itself is pretty simple. The structure of the "golden days" of particle
physics from the 50s, 60s and 70s is obvious. This is the period of them when a lot of particles and
symmetry rules were being discovered and the coherent picture of what we now know as the Standard Model
was being put together and theoretical framework being completed in the late 60s.
The US dominance from 1960 on is obvious, although there's no U.S. particle physicists
that earned a Nobel Prize in this current decade, yet. There's still one year to go.

It is interesting though to see a seemingly slowing-down of total prizes awarded to
particle physics, but with great puzzles of dark matter, the ones in neutrino sector,
the strong CP problem, the field undoubtedly holds tremendous potential for paradigm-shifting
discoveries. We just need to find the right lamp post to shed light on the known and unknown unknowns
and open up a new era of discoveries that will transform our human beings' understanding of the universe.
