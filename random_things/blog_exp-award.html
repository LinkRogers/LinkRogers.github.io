This plot shows the time lag in years between the corresponding experimental discovery
and the awarding of the prize. Clearly and probably not surprisingly, this lag on
average is not very long with a mode of 3 years and a pretty fat tail.

The shortest time lag champion goes to the 1957 Nobel Prize to Lee and Yang with
the lag less than a year. Motivated by the so-called &#977;-&#964; puzzle, Lee and Yang
made an important observation that despite ample evidence for parity conservation in strong and
electromagnetic interactions, there was no evidence, neither for nor against, the
conservation of parity in the weak interactions. They submitted their paper in June
of 1956, talked to their colleague C.S. Wu, who quickly and elegantly set up the
famous Wu experiment and found, over Chrismas of 1956, that parity is violated
(maximally) in the weak interactions! Because this discovery was such a huge surprise
at the time, Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1957 in October of 1957,
less than a year from the experimental discovery!

Both the second and third places go to the crucial components to the spontaneously broken
electroweak sector, the W and Z vector gauge bosons in 1984 and the Higgs boson in 2013.
These two were perhaps particularly unsurprising because they had been anticipated for so long.
In fact, the green components show all the prizes that were awarded due to discoveries
of new particle(s), for which time lags were quite short -- mostly less than five years!

However, there's an important and intriguing exception to that -- you typically don't need to
wait long to get a Nobel Prize if you discover a Nobel worthy particle, unless it was
a neutrino. The first ever detection of (anti)neutrinos was made by Cowan and Reines in 1956
but Reines' Nobel Prize came only in 1995, almost 40 years later (Cowan had passed away by 1995).
The detection of muon neutrino, proving that there were more than one flavor of neutrinos,
was made by Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger in 1962 but they had to wait for 26 years to
get their Nobel Prizes in 1988. Moreover, it simply seems unfair that any neutrino-related Nobel-worthy so
far had to wait quite long to get accredited. Ray Davis had to wait for 34 years for the detection of
solar neutrinos by Ray Davis and even the shortest, also the most recent one, among the neutrino-related
prizes had Kajita and McDonald wait for almost 15 years before they were awarded for their
monumental discoveries of neutrino oscillation. Hopefully, this trend is going to change soon.
Any of the major themes in neutrino physics nowadays, be it the measurement of the absolute
mass scale of neutrinos, or the search for neutrinoless double beta decays, or the determination
of the CP phase in the neutrino mixing matrix, holds great potential for Nobel-worthy discoveries
that will lead to a hopefully much shorter lag time.
