        <h2>Shi Li / Senior AI Scientist</h2>
        <p>
          Signal update: I am a Senior AI Scientist at Bosch, engineering GenAI systems that rewire SAP-era business
          processes for intelligent automation and decision-grade insights. I build next-gen AI pipelines that turn
          enterprise data into faster decisions and smarter operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus: AI-driven efficiency, enterprise intelligence, and pragmatic innovation. I design solutions that
          are scalable, secure, and ready for production—so businesses can move faster in a digital-first world.
