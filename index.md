        <h2>Shi Li / Cyber-Mechanical Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          I am Shi Li from University of Michigan, studying as a Mechanical Engineer with a MS degree.
          I have been actively doing computer vision research at the UM &amp; Ford Center for Autonomous
          Vehicles (FCAV). My research work includes: Velodyne Lidar scan pattern simulation, 3D image
          segmentation and RGB-D image detection. I am targeting opportunities to work on Autonomous
          Vehicle and Driver Assistance systems related technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe I can not only apply the knowledge I learned from school to the industry world but
          also come up with creative and novel solutions that will bring the customers even better experience.
