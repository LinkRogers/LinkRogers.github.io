I am Shi Li from University of Michigan, studying as a Mechanical Engineer  with a MS degree. I have been actively doing computer vision research at the UM & Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles (FCAV). My research work includes: Velodyne Lidar scan pattern simulation, 3D image segmentation and  RGB-D image detection. I am targeting opportunities to work on Autonomous Vehicle and Driver Assistance systems related technologies.

I believe I can not only apply the knowledge I learned from school to the industry world but also come up with creative and novel solutions that will bring the customers even better experience.
