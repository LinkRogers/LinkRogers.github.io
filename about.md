### About Me

I am a Senior AI Scientist at Bosch, operating at the intersection of GenAI and enterprise systems. My mission is to
upgrade SAP-era workflows into intelligent, automated, and insight-driven pipelines that keep businesses ahead of the
curve.

I specialize in building production-ready AI systems that enhance efficiency, decision quality, and operational
resilience. My interests include enterprise automation, scalable AI architectures, and cyber-styled innovation that
turns data into strategic action.
